            The Cyan Cleanup and Collection Club (CCCC) is a small grassroots
            organization that collects and documents litter found on Planet
            Cyan, a jewel in the Chromeda system loved by locals and travelers
            alike, located approximately 7.2 light-years* away.

            rotation of Earth (the last centralized planet occupied by humans)
            around its star. Approximately 5.879e12 ens.
